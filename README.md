## ChatRoom using MERN Stack

Web App: https://chat-room-client-livid.vercel.app/connect

Back-end: https://github.com/UddhavSJadhav/ChatRoomServer

-	Developed a real-time chat application using MERN stack and Socket.IO.
-	The application features a sidebar that displays new messages in conversations that the user is not currently viewing, and a chat section that displays a sorted list of messages and a textarea for users to enter new messages.
-	The application uses Socket.IO to enable real-time messaging between users, and I gained valuable experience working with this technology during the development process.
